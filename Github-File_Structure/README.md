### This Extension will showcase the File directory and folder structure of Github repositories, User is currently into. It helps developers to get an idea from the beginning about folder structure rather than clicking on each folder and remembering. 

### In this extension I used Github REST API to fetch data about the Repository Files and Javascript to handle the received response and show it on the Frontend as a Sidebar to show the Folder structure to the user
