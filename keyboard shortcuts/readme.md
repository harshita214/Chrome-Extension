# introduction

A keyboard shortcut tool for keyboard-based page navigation and browser tab operations with an advanced omnibar and global shortcuts so you may take full advantages of your browser without a mouse or touchpad
I am listing some shortcuts here

* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page
* press `o` to show a search panel ("Vomnibar", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete
* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages
* press "/" to search for text; press "v" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)
* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab
* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands
* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs
