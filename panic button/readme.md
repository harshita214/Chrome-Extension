# Introduction

Easily hide and restore all open tabs with the click of a button!
Panic Button is an extension that lets you easily hide and restore all tabs

To hide (close) all tabs, please press on the toolbar icon once. Next time when you click on the toolbar button again, all hidden tabs are restored to the previous session. Please note that this addon does not have any settings or options to adjust.  Instead of the toolbar button, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Alt+Shift+A) to hide and restore tabs
